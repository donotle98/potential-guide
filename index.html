                <p>My name is</p> <h2>Donovan Le</h2> <p>I am from Colorado Spring, Colorado.
                I am a Software Engineering student. I hope one day to become actually be able to call myself
                 an actual Software Engineer. It actually took me a while to realize I was into programming. During my
                first three years in college as a Business Finance major, I wanted to go work with stocks for major
                companies. I was introduced to programming by my step-dad. He is quite the successful developer over
                at Apple. To this day, he helps me with all my little to big programming questions. To be quite honest,
                 I have a lot of them. </p>

                        <p>For the past two years that I have been studying code, I have managed to complete multiple
                         personal and school projects. My favorite personal project would my first ever portfolio site.
                         I wrote it using HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. It was a fun and great starter project. My
                        favorite school project I have ever done was a Library management system written in C++.
                        It required a whole bunch of methods. Objects, classes, user input, dynamic memory allocation,
                        exception handling, switch statements, text files, modifying text files, header files,
                        and much more. It was extremely challenging, luckily I worked in a group. Everyone split
                        the jobs and we made it a successful project. I did a few projects in Java, and Python as well.
                        I am currently learning React and Goland.</p>

                    <p>There are plenty of things I like to do outside of programming. I like playing video games, I
                    like to read non-fiction books, I like to bike, I like to golf, I like photography, but probably the thing that I
                    find most interesting is building and learning about computers. I got into building computers about
                    three years ago, and ever since then a lot of time goes into learning about it. I have built
                    my own PC, I have helped my friends build their own PC's and I am quite active on PC building forums.
                     I use to be quite into playing sports like football, basketball, track & field. But nowadays
                    I am really only playing golf. I have never been much of an outdoors person, but given where I
                    live I am trying to get out into nature more by hiking and biking. There is plenty of great
                    scenery where I am. Other than that, when I am trying to relax, video games and reading books about
                    psychology is what I am doing.</p>
