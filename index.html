                <p>My name is Donovan Le. I am a Computer Science student from Colorado.
                    However, I did live the majority of my life in California. I currently reside in Arkansas. I started my path in
                    CS my third year of college. It took me a while to realize that I am really interested in programming.
                    At first I was super interested in business finance, I wanted to be a CPA. After a couple years, almost getting
                    my AS in business, I switched over to CS. It was probably the best thing I have ever done. The more work
                    I do in programming, the more I want to do it. I really enjoy it. I am currently starting
                    a bootcamp. I am in the process of the prep-course and I am loving it. This prep-course is all about
                    coding and learning to work with others. It is really amazing.</p>

                        <p>I've done many school and personal projects so far in my time of learning computer science. They range from
                            building "To-Do" list using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. To Library management systems using C++. The management
                            system would use dynamic memory allocation, c-string functions, classes and objects. I created a spell checker
                            that would use the exact same thing, but in a completely more simple way. All my applications are different
                            and they vary difficulty. There is this website I designed for myself, which so happened to be the first thing
                            I ever built. It used HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It was sort of complex, and yet pretty simple compared
                            to other professionally built websites.</p>

                    <p>There are plenty of things I like to do outside of programming. I like playing video games, I
                    like to read non-fiction books, I like to bike, I like to golf, I like photography, but probably the thing that I
                    find most interesting is building and learning about computers. I got into building computers about
                    three years ago, and ever since then a lot of time goes into learning about it. I have built
                    my own PC, I have helped my friends build their own PC's and I am quite active on PC building forums.
                     I use to be quite into playing sports like football, basketball, track & field. But nowadays
                    I am really only playing golf. I have never been much of an outdoors person, but given where I
                    live I am trying to get out into nature more by hiking and biking. There is plenty of great
                    scenery where I am. Other than that, when I am trying to relax, video games and videos about
                    hypothetical science theories is where it is at for me.</p>
